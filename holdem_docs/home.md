Purpose and Scope
The texasholdem package is a comprehensive Python implementation of Texas Hold'em Poker that provides game logic, card representation, hand evaluation, user interfaces, and agent capabilities. This document introduces the core features, architecture, and usage of the package, serving as a starting point for both users and developers.

For installation instructions, see Installation and Setup. For detailed API documentation, see API Reference.

Key Features
The texasholdem package offers a robust implementation of Texas Hold'em Poker with the following key features:

Complete Game Logic: Implementation following World Series of Poker Official Rules
Fast Hand Evaluation: Efficient evaluation of poker hands using integer-based card representation and lookup tables
Game History: Export and import game history in human-readable format
User Interfaces: Text-based GUI for playing and replaying games
AI Agents: Simple agents (random, call) and support for custom agent development
Card System: Fast 32-bit integer representation of cards for efficient operations

Getting Started
Installation
The package is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:

pip install texasholdem
For the latest experimental version:

pip install texasholdem --pre
Sources: 
README.md
38-48

Quick Example
Here's a simple example to get started with a text-based interface:

from texasholdem.game.game import TexasHoldEm
from texasholdem.gui.text_gui import TextGUI

game = TexasHoldEm(buyin=500, big_blind=5, small_blind=2, max_players=6)
gui = TextGUI(game=game)

while game.is_game_running():
    game.start_hand()

    while game.is_hand_running():
        gui.run_step()

    path = game.export_history('./pgns')     # save history
    gui.replay_history(path)                 # replay history
Sources: 
README.md

Core Components
Game Logic
The TexasHoldEm class is the main entry point for game operations. It manages the game state, enforces rules, and provides methods for taking actions and querying game information.

from texasholdem import TexasHoldEm, HandPhase, ActionType

game = TexasHoldEm(buyin=500, big_blind=5, small_blind=2, max_players=9)
game.start_hand()

assert game.hand_phase == HandPhase.PREFLOP
assert game.chips_to_call(game.current_player) == game.big_blind

game.take_action(ActionType.CALL)

README.md
76-100

Card System
Cards are represented as 32-bit integers for fast operations and evaluation:

from texasholdem import Card

card = Card("Kd")                       # King of Diamonds
assert isinstance(card, int)            # True
assert card.rank == 11                  # 2nd highest rank (0-12)
assert card.pretty_string == "[ K â™¦ ]"
Sources: 
README.md
102-113

Hand Evaluation
The evaluator module provides fast evaluation of poker hands:

from texasholdem import Card
from texasholdem.evaluator import evaluate, rank_to_string

hand_rank = evaluate(cards=[Card("Kd"), Card("5d")],
               board=[Card("Qd"),
                      Card("6d"),
                      Card("5s"),
                      Card("2d"),
                      Card("5h")])
assert hand_rank == 927
assert rank_to_string(927) == "Flush, King High"
Sources: 
README.md
154-169

Agents
The package comes with basic agents that can be used for automated play:

from texasholdem import TexasHoldEm
from texasholdem.agents import random_agent, call_agent

game = TexasHoldEm(buyin=500, big_blind=5, small_blind=2)
game.start_hand()

while game.is_hand_running():
    if game.current_player % 2 == 0:
        game.take_action(*random_agent(game))
    else:
        game.take_action(*call_agent(game))
Sources: 
README.md
115-130

Game History
Export and import game histories to/from human-readable files:

# export to file
game.export_history("./pgns/my_game.pgn")

# import and replay
gui = TextGUI()
gui.replay_history("./pgns/my_game.pgn")

The architecture follows a layered design with clear separation of concerns. Applications use the public API to interact with the game system, while the infrastructure layer handles the implementation details like card encoding and lookup tables.
